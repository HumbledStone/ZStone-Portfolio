# Zack Stone's Portfolio
A portfolio of my works from the 2017 online .NET/C# Software Guild Cohort. 
I am slowly going through and refactoring code as I continue to grow as a developer. 

## Guessing Game :mag::grey_question:
This is a simple Console application that was assigned at the beggining of the course. 
This was to showcase conditional loops and general types like ints, booleans, and strings. 

The application is a game where the user can pick either easy, normal, or hard difficulty settings. The user then attempts to guess a number that the game randomaly generates. 

Have a go, and try to guess the number within 5 trys on the hard difficulty level!
